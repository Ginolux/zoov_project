Microservices app with Flask, MongoDB, Kombu/RabbitMQ and UI


# Cinema 3 - (Extremely Simplified) Example of Microservices in Python


Overview
========
This project is a test to demonstrate the use of microvervices to achieve something similar to what are been developed at Zoov.

The application is powered by 3 microservices, all of them written in Python 3 using Flask.

* Gateway Service: It is the main entry point of the application. It provides information like list of bikes, bike data, trip data.
It also sends message to the message broker, in this case RabbitMQ, for location update on the two other services.
* Bike Service: It provides the list of all bikes and return a bike data if the id is given. It also consumes event sent by the gateway to update the bikes location.
* Trip Service: It takes a bike id and starts a trip if the corresponding bike is not already in use and return the newly created trip id. It ends a trip , make the associated bike available and return the trip to the user.




<!-- Cinema 3 is an example project which demonstrates the use of microservices for a fictional movie theater. 
The Cinema 3 backend is powered by 4 microservices, all of which happen to be written in Python using 
Flask.

 * Movie Service: Provides information like movie ratings, title, etc.
 * Show Times Service: Provides show times information.
 * Booking Service: Provides booking information. 
 * Users Service: Provides movie suggestions for users by communicating with other services. -->

Requirements
============

* This project uses python 3
* The virtual environment requirements are in "requirements.txt"
* The database used is MongoDB 2.6.10
* RabbitMQ 3.7.6 is the message broker used to manage events sent across services. 


<!-- * Python 2.7
* Works on Linux, Windows, Mac OSX and (quite possibly) BSD. -->

Install
========
* To install python 3 on Debian/Ubuntu system:
<code>
$ sudo apt install python3-devel
</code>

* Install the virtual environment on Debian/Ubuntu system:
<code>
$ pip install virtualenv
</code>
or 
<code>
$ sudo apt install virtualenv
</code>
* To create a virtual environment:
Ex: 
<code>
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
</code>
* To install all the required modules:
First activate the virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate` and then install the modules.
<code>
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
</code>



Starting and Stopping Services
==============================

* To launch the services, from each service folder, run:
<code>
$ python manage.py runserver
</code>

* To stop the services, type `Ctl+c` on the keyboard



APIs and Documentation
======================

## Gateway Service (port 8080)

The service is used as a gateway to route request to the concerned service and receive the response from that service. It provides the informations return by the other services such as bike id, location, trip id and other information.

* To lookup all the bikes in the database, go to:
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`

    GET /
    Returns a list of all bikes.

    {
        "_id": {
            "$oid": "5b34299e4042be787bd66362"
        }, 
        "location": {
            "coordinates": [
            2.286146, 
            48.826802
            ], 
            "type": "Point"
        }, 
        "status": 1
    },

* To lookup by id:
`http://127.0.0.1:8080\<id>`
Depending on the bike status (ie. bike in use or not),

    GET /5b3429a54042be787bd6636
    Returns new trip id.

    New trip ID	"5b37bc08b07c1a0ac4cd1120"
