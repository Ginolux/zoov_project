===========================================================

### Demo
Link to start the demo :arrow_forward: http://52.212.180.26:8080/ 
RabbitMQ management interface on http://52.212.180.26:8888, with the username and password of guest / guest 



Overview :bike:
========

This project is a test to demonstrate the use of microvervices to achieve something similar to what are been developed at Zoov.

The application is powered by 3 microservices, all written in Python 3 using Flask.

* Gateway Service: It is the main entry point of the application. It provides information like list of bikes, bike data, trip data.
It also sends message to the message broker, in this case RabbitMQ, for location update on the two other services.
* Bike Service: It provides the list of all bikes and return a bike data if the id is given. It also consumes event sent by the gateway to update the bikes location.
* Trip Service: It takes a bike id and starts a trip if the corresponding bike is not already in use and return the newly created trip id. It ends a trip , make the associated bike available and return the trip to the user.



Requirements
============

* This project uses python 3.
* The project requirements are in "requirements.txt" file.
* The database used is MongoDB 2.6.10.
* RabbitMQ 3.7.6 is the message broker used to manage events sent across the services. 



Install
========

* To install python 3 on Debian/Ubuntu system:
```
$ sudo apt install python3-devel
```

* To install the virtual environment on Debian/Ubuntu system:
```
$ pip install virtualenv
```
or 

```
$ sudo apt install virtualenv
```

* To create a virtual environment:
Ex: 
```
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
```

* To install all the required modules:
First activate the virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate` and then install the modules.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```



Starting and Stopping Services
==============================

* To launch the services, from each service folder, run:
```
$ python manage.py runserver
```

* To stop the services, type `Ctl+c` on the keyboard



APIs and Documentation
======================

## Gateway Service (port 8080)

The service is used as a gateway to route request to the concerned service and receive the response from that service. It provides the informations return by the other services such as bike id, location, trip id and other information.


**To lookup all the bikes in the database, go to:**  
* `http://127.0.0.1:8080`  

GET /  
Returns a list of all bikes.  

```json
    {
        "_id": {

Messaging service: Kombu/RabbitMQ
=================================
In this case, the message broker used is RabbitMQ. Kombu, a messaging library for Python is used as client to connect to the broker. It provides a high-level interface for the AMQ protocol used by RabbitMQ.

## Setup
RabbitMQ is deployed in docker for fast deployment. Here is the link to setup the doker container: https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/  
  
The management web interface run on port 8888 on the localhost with the default username and password of guest / guest.

### Producer
The producer run on the gateway service and send events to the message broker. Those events are consumed by the other two services to update the bike location and add the point to the trip history.  

Kombu, the RabbitMQ client run as deamon on different thread on the flash server and listen to event sent to the gateway service on this uri:  
* http://127.0.0.1:8080/event  

POST /event
Return ack message

```bash
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "@event.json" http://127.0.0.1:8080/event
```

You will find `event.json` file in the project root folder. Run the curl command from the same directory.  

Event received is instantaniouly sent to the broker and published to all the subscribers.  


### Consumers
* Each, Bike service and Trip service run the Kombu consumer as deamon on a different thread to listen to event sent by the producer.  


The event is used by the two services to update the bike location and the trips history of locations.


## Configuation
* AMQP: "amqp://localhost:5672/"
* Producer: Deamon run on Gateway service
* Consumer: Deamon run on both Bike and Trip services
* Queue: name="gateway-queue"
* Message: It comes from the `event.json` file, sent from the producer to the consumers through RabbitMQ
* Connection: It is a TCP connection between the services and RabbitMQ broker
* Channel: A virtual channel is created for each client when publishing or consuming messages
* Exchange: name="gateway-exchange", type="fanout". A fanout exchange routes messages to all of the queues that are bound to it.
